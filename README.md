# **AERO workorder management tools**

AERO is a web application built to control the flow of work in a bicycle service shop. 

### Profiles

Profiles can be created by the user, or the administrator. As a user, you have access to create and edit your contact information, and to view workorders attached to your profile. 

An administrator has access to all profiles, and can create, edit and delete them as required. 

### Workorders

Workorders are created by the administrator upon intake of the bicycle. The workorder will set the expectations of work to be performed, at what cost, and for a specific due date. 

As a user, only workorders that are attached to your profile will be viewable. 

## How to start Aero

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start:client`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run start:server`
